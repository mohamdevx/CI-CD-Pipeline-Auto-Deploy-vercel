# CI/CD Pipeline with Next.js and Vercel

This project is a demonstration of setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Next.js application, with automatic deployments to Vercel.

The goal is to have a streamlined workflow where every push to the `main` branch on GitHub automatically triggers a new deployment on Vercel.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Vercel for deployment.

## Getting Started

To run the development server locally, first install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
